Cat;That's pawesome!,Purrfect,Meowth! That's right,Are you furreal?,You gotta be kitten me,That's hiss-terical,a pun purr-haps?
Dog;Sound's ruff,You're barking mad,Hold on let me get some pup-corn,Let's raise the woof!,Such a mal-tease,Fur-give me for these puns
Pizza;Do we knead to know this?,I'll get in on a slice of that action!,You could call me a bit of a pizza afficionadough,Don't be a weirdough, I would make a pun but it's a bit cheesey
